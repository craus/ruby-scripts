# # - comment
# \s, \t and \n - separators
# is - keyword for defining function
# nil - builtin constant
# pair x y - builtin function, returns data structure of two parts x and y.
# first p - builtin function, given pair x y, returns x
# second p - builtin function, given pair x y, returns y
# if cond x y - builtin function, returns x if cond is pair of something and y otherwise (only "else" case is when cond is nil)
# bin - builtin function, returns pair nil nil if bit 1 readed from console and nil otherwise
# bout x - builtin function, write 1 to console if x is not nil and write 0 here otherwise. Always returns pair nil nil.
# eof - builtin function, returns pair nil nil if input stream is ended and nil otherwise
# main - builtin identificator of main function, it should not take any arguments.

#std lib:

0 is nil
1 is pair nil nil

true is 1
false is 0
then x is x
else x is x
both x y is if x then y else false
either x y is if x then true else y
not x is if x then false else true
neither x y is if x then false else not y

char b0 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 is pair pair pair b0 b1 pair b2 b3 pair pair b4 b5 pair b6 b7 
cin is char bin bin bin bin bin bin bin bin

bout2 x is both bout first x bout second x
bout4 x is both bout2 first x bout2 second x
cout c is both bout4 first c bout4 second c

'A' = char 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

Problem: read one of three bit sequences
0 - output 1
01 - no output
11 - output 0

Solution:

0 is nil
1 is pair nil nil
main is 
	if bin 
		bout 0 
		if eof 
			bout 1 
			nil
